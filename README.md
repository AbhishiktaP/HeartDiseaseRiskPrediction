# Heart Disease Prediction Using Feature selection and Machine Learning Ensemble


## Project Overview

The prediction and classification of heart disease remain pivotal in advancing healthcare outcomes and preventive medicine. This project delves into the exploration and analysis of a clinical dataset using statistical and probabilistic methodologies to classify if individuals are at risk of heart diseases or not . By leveraging robust data pre-processing techniques, model evaluation frameworks, and advanced visualization tools, we aim to uncover underlying patterns and correlations
within the data. The primary objective is to apply concepts from probability and statistics, aligning with a systematic approach to enhance classification accuracy.

## About Data 


**1. Age:** Patients Age in years (Numeric)<br>
**2. Sex:** Gender of patient (Male - 1, Female - 0) (Nominal)<br>
**3. Chest Pain Type:** Type of chest pain experienced by patient categorized into 1 typical, 2 typical angina, 3 non-anginal pain, 4 asymptomatic (Nominal)<br>
**4. resting bp s:** Level of blood pressure at resting mode in mm/HG (Numerical)<br>
**5. cholestrol:** Serum cholestrol in mg/dl (Numeric)<br>
**6. fasting blood sugar:** Blood sugar levels on fasting > 120 mg/dl represents as 1 in case of true and 0 as false (Nominal)<br>
**7. resting ecg:** Result of electrocardiogram while at rest are represented in 3 distinct values 0 : Normal 1: Abnormality in ST-T wave 2: Left ventricular hypertrophy (Nominal)<br>
**8. max heart rate:** Maximum heart rate achieved (Numeric)<br>
**9. exercise angina:** Angina induced by exercise 0 depicting NO 1 depicting Yes (Nominal)<br>
**10. oldpeak:** Exercise induced ST-depression in comparison with the state of rest (Numeric)<br>
**11. ST slope:** ST segment measured in terms of slope during peak exercise 0: Normal 1: Upsloping 2: Flat 3: Downsloping (Nominal)<br>

#### Target variable
**12. target:** It is the target variable which we have to predict 1 means patient is suffering from heart risk and 0 means patient is normal.
